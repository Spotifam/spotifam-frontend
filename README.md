This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Download and Run

1. Go to [Spotifam Auth Server](https://github.com/Spotifam/spotifam-auth) and follow its instructions to download and run it.
2. Either `git clone` or `git pull` this repo to your local machine
3. Run `npm install` to download the current node_modules
4. Run `npm start`. This will open the website on your localhost:3000

Note: In order to login to Spotify, you'll need this React server (localhost:3000) and the auth server (localhost:8888) running at the same time.
